# Swift-5-Trivia-Quiz-Game

This is a simple Swift trivia quiz game. The Trivia game includes 20 questions of random trivia. The app is a Swift (re)make of the original Python version using Apple's Swift language and SwiftUI framework for a Apple-friendly & mobile iOS version.
This was done to further self-teach and familiarize myself with the Swift language and the SwiftUI framework.


Windows cannot use Swift for Application Development, only to run code. My MacOS setup is currently too weak to do Application Development, so I will have to try to find a newer (M) ARM-CPU/GPU Mac to use for development for XCode.
