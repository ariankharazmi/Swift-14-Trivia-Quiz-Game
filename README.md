# Swift-14-Trivia-Quiz-Game

This is a simple Swift trivia quiz game. The Trivia game includes 20 questions of random trivia. The app is a Swift (re)make of the original Python version using Apple's Swift language and SwiftUI framework for a mobile iOS version.
This was done to further self-teach and familiarize myself with the Swift language and the SwiftUI framework.
